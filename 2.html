<p style="margin-top:40px;"><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_(South_Korean_band)>Seventeen (SVT)</a> is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino.</p>
<p>They debuted on May 26, 2015, with the EP 17 Carat. The album became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and was the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" chart. Seventeen performs as one group, and the members are divided into three units, each with a different area of specialization: 'Hip-Hop Team', 'Vocal Team', and 'Performance Team'. Since its debut, Seventeen has released three studio albums and twelve EPs.</p>
<p>Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members being actively involved in the songwriting, choreographing, and other aspects of their music and performances. The group has often been labeled as "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-pop", and "K-pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.</p>
